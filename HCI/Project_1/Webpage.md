# Design Focus and Problem Space

## Overiew of Piazza

Piazza is marketed as a tool "designed to connect students, TAs, and professors so every student can get the help they need when they need it". It is a website that provides a "wiki-style Q&A" where students can post questions and get answers from professors or even other students about class content and homework clarifications. In the era of remote learning, its become a one-stop hub for all question regarding a class allowing everyone to see common questions. However, currently Piazza is quite disorganized and contains many great features that are underused as they are hard to find. In this project, we explore hopw we can improve the user experience for Piazza.

## Target Users


## Key Problems with Piazza

As we mentioned, the main thing to keep in mind is efficiency as both students and professors want to make sure they get their answers sooner than later. However, as seasoned users of Piazza, its clear that the current platform is quite disorganized and to this day we are still discovering new features with Piazza. We will explore this more in our Contextual Inquiry, however here are some of the general problems we will want to address:
- No feedback after performing certain actions such as posting a response.
- It takes too many clicks to get to basic things - such as course info or your settings.
- Piazza doesn't have specific places to put content so classes put things in different places, like the syllabus.
- After clicking on a course, you are just bombarded with the threads and no info.
- Piazza has class subgroups but they are not very intuitive to use.
- Piazza’s professional network often gets in the way of trying to see things for your class.
- Students can not pin and save threads making it harder to find posts again.
